# NavigationStackReferenceSwiftUI
This project is part of a study series for interview preparation. It dives deep into the different ways of using navigation stacks in SwiftUI, including how to use navigation paths. The aim is also to create a more reusable navigation manager for future SwiftUI applications.

## Features

- Implementation of `NavigationStack` for navigating between views in SwiftUI.
- Use of `navigationLink` to have easy navigation.
- Use of `NavigationPath` for more flexible navigation.
- A `Router` class to handle view navigation more intuitively.
